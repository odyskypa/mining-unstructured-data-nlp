# Natural Language Processing with Traditional Machine Learning (ML) and Deep Learning (DL)
Project of Mining Unstructed Data (MUD) Course for Master in Data Science Program of Universitat Polit√®cnica de Catalunya (UPC)
***
The project is divided into 3 separate parts:

1. Language Detection
2. Name Entity Recognition and Classification (NERC) and Drug-Drug Interaction Detection and Classification (DDI) with Traditional Machine Learning (ML) Techniques
3. NERC and DDI with state-of-the-art Deep Learning (DL) Techniques

Below one can find information about the 3 parts of the project.

***
### Language Detection
Analysis of performance of several preprocessing techniques and Machine Learning models for `Language Detection` task. Word and character tokenization was tested, as well as several different vocabulary sizes.

#### Preprocessing Steps
Preprocessing includes the usage of `NTLK` library, for `tokenization`, `lemmatization` and `POS tagging` of words or characters.

#### Classifiers Implemented

* MultinomialNB
* KNeighborsClassifier
* DecisionTreeClassifier
* SVC

The source code used for this part of the project can be found in [Language Detection](http://example.com)
